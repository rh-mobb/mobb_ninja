This guide demonstrates how to properly patch the cluster ingress controllers, as well as ingress controllers created by the Custom Domain Operator. This functionality allows customers to modify the tlsSecurityProfile value on cluster ingress controllers. This guide will demonstrate how to apply a custom tlsSecurityProfile, a scoped service account (with the associated role and role binding), and a CronJob that the cipher changes are reapplied with 60 minutes (in the event that an ingress controller is recreated or modified).</description></item><item><title>Jupyter Notebooks</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/jup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/jup/</guid><description>You will need the following prerequistes in order to run a basic Jupyter notebook with GPU on OpenShift
1. A OpenShift Cluster This will assume you have already provisioned a OpenShift cluster succesfully and are able to use it.
You will need to log in as cluster admin to deploy GPU Operator.
2. OpenShift Command Line Interface Please see the OpenShift Command Line section for more information on installing.

However, when a route with custom domain is created, both default router and custom domain router serve routes. This article describes how to use route labels to stop default router from serving custom domain routes.

21 June 2021
In OpenShift images (stored in the in-cluster registry) are protected by Kubernetes RBAC and by default only the namespace in which the image was built can access it.
For example if you build an image in project-a only project-a can use that image, or build from it. If you wanted the default service account in project-b to have access to the images in project-a you would run the following.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Cost Management for Cloud Services</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/cost-management/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/cost-management/</guid><description>Author: Charlotte Fung

Adopted from Official Documentation for Cost Management Service
Red Hat Cost Management is a software as a service (SaaS) offering available free of charge as part of your Red Hat subscriptions. Cost management helps you monitor and analyze your OpenShift Container Platform and Public cloud costs in order to improve the management of your business.
Some capabilities of cost management are :
Visualize costs across hybrid cloud infrastructure Track cost trends Map charges to projects and organizations Normalize data and add markups with cost models Generate showback and chargeback information In this document, I will show you how to connect your OpenShift and Cloud provider sources to Cost Management in order to collect cost and usage.</description></item><item><title>MOBB Docs and Guides - oadp</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/oadp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/oadp/</guid><description>MOBB Docs and Guides for OADP Deploying OADP on ROSA</description></item><item><title>Common Managed OpenShift References / Tasks</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/references/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/references/</guid><description>Common Managed OpenShift References / Tasks Managed OpenShift Overviews Red Hat OpenShift Managed services Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift - ARO Red Hat OpenShift on AWS - ROSA Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated - OSD Managed OpenShift Documentation OpenShift Container Platform v4.7 Azure Red Hat OpenShift v4.x - ARO Red Hat OpenShift on AWS v4.x - ROSA Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud v4.x OpenShift Dedicated v4.</description></item></channel></rss>

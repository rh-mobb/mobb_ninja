By default, within OSD in GCP only the GCE-PD StorageClass is available in the cluster. With this StorageClass, only ReadWriteOnce mode is permitted, and the gcePersistentDisks can only be mounted by a single consumer in read-write mode.
Because of that, and for provide Storage with Shared Access (RWX) Access Mode to our OpenShift clusters a GCP Filestore could be used.
GCP Filestore is not managed neither supported by Red Hat or Red Hat SRE team.</description></item><item><title>Creating a OSD in GCP with Existing VPCs</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/gcp/osd_preexisting_vpc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/gcp/osd_preexisting_vpc/</guid><description>Roberto Carratalá, Andrea Bozzoni

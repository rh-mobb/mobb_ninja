The Azure Service Operator (ASO) provides Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for Azure resources that can be used to create, update, and delete Azure services from an OpenShift cluster.
This example uses ASO V1, which has now been replaced by ASO V2. ASO V2 does not (as of 5/19/2022) yet have an entry in the OCP OperatorHub, but is functional and should be preferred for use, especially if V1 isn&amp;rsquo;t already installed on a cluster.</description></item><item><title>Azure Service Operator V2 in ARO</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/azure-service-operator/v2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/aro/azure-service-operator/v2/</guid><description>Thatcher Hubbard

This example uses ASO V2, which is a replacement for ASO V1. Equivalent documentation for ASO V1 can be found here. For new installs, V2 is recommended. MOBB has not tested running them in parallel.

You can install it from the OpenShift web console:
From the OpenShift web console, log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges. For a developer installation from try.openshift.com including AWS and CRC, the kubeadmin user will work.
Create a new project named ‘jph-demo’ for your installation of Open Data Hub Find Open Data Hub in the OperatorHub catalog.</description></item><item><title>Jupyter Notebooks</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/jup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/jup/</guid><description>You will need the following prerequistes in order to run a basic Jupyter notebook with GPU on OpenShift

21 June 2021
In OpenShift images (stored in the in-cluster registry) are protected by Kubernetes RBAC and by default only the namespace in which the image was built can access it.
For example if you build an image in project-a only project-a can use that image, or build from it. If you wanted the default service account in project-b to have access to the images in project-a you would run the following.</description></item><item><title>OpenShift Logging</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/o11y/openshift-logging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/o11y/openshift-logging/</guid><description>A guid to shipping logs and metrics on OpenShift

Prerequisites OpenShift CLI (oc) Rights to install operators on the cluster Setup OpenShift Logging This is for setup of centralized logging on OpenShift making use of Elasticsearch OSS edition. This largely follows the processes outlined in the OpenShift documentation here. Retention and storage considerations are reviewed in Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s primary source documentation.
This setup is primarily concerned with simplicity and basic log searching.</description></item></channel></rss>

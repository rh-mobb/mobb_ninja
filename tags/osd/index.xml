This guide demonstrates how to properly patch the cluster ingress controllers, as well as ingress controllers created by the Custom Domain Operator. This functionality allows customers to modify the tlsSecurityProfile value on cluster ingress controllers. This guide will demonstrate how to apply a custom tlsSecurityProfile, a scoped service account (with the associated role and role binding), and a CronJob that the cipher changes are reapplied with 60 minutes (in the event that an ingress controller is recreated or modified).</description></item><item><title>Stop default router from serving custom domain routes</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/default-router-custom-domain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/misc/default-router-custom-domain/</guid><description>OSD and ROSA supports custom domain operator to serve application custom domain, which provisions openshift ingress controller and cloud load balancers. However, when a route with custom domain is created, both default router and custom domain router serve routes. This article describes how to use route labels to stop default router from serving custom domain routes.

This guide demonstrates how to configure Azure AD as the cluster identity provider in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). This guide will walk through the creation of an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application and configure Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) to authenticate using Azure AD.
This guide will walk through the following steps:

By default, within OSD in GCP only the GCE-PD StorageClass is available in the cluster. With this StorageClass, only ReadWriteOnce mode is permitted, and the gcePersistentDisks can only be mounted by a single consumer in read-write mode.
Because of that, and for provide Storage with Shared Access (RWX) Access Mode to our OpenShift clusters a GCP Filestore could be used.
GCP Filestore is not managed neither supported by Red Hat or Red Hat SRE team.</description></item><item><title>Creating a OSD in GCP with Existing VPCs</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/gcp/osd_preexisting_vpc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 22:07:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/gcp/osd_preexisting_vpc/</guid><description>Roberto Carratalá, Andrea Bozzoni

Tip The official documentation for installing a OSD cluster in GCP can be found here.
For deploy an OSD cluster in GCP using existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) you need to implement some prerequisites that you must create before starting the OpenShift Dedicated installation though the OCM.
Prerequisites gcloud CLI jq NOTE: Also the GCloud Shell can be used, and have the gcloud cli among other tools preinstalled.</description></item><item><title>OSD on Google Cloud</title><link>https://mobb.ninja/docs/gcp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobb.ninja/docs/gcp/</guid><description> Filestore Storage for OSD on GCP Creating OSD on GCP w/ Existing VPC</description></item></channel></rss>
